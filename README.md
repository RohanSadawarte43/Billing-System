# Billing-System

This idea was to put barcode scnanner on the cart and whenever the customer wants to buy a product before puting it into the cart, he can just scann the barcode of the produt on the screen it will show the price of the product and add it in the list. Doing the same process for every product will automatically create a list of product with the prices. So by this the customers need not stand in long queue and just have to pay at the end instead of following the normal procedure.
